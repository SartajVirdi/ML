# ML

This repository is a personal playground for implementing and experimenting with core machine learning concepts.

## Purpose

The main objective of this repository is to:

- Reinforce theoretical concepts learned in college courses, online courses (e.g., Coursera), and other sources.
- Build hands-on experience by implementing algorithms from scratch or using libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.
- Track progress and understanding over time through practical notebooks and examples.

## Structure

- `Sandbox1/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks implementing basic ML algorithms and techniques.
  - `Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Implementation and exploration of linear regression.
  - `PCA_Basic.ipynb`: Basic walkthrough and example of Principal Component Analysis.

More folders and notebooks will be added as I continue learning and exploring additional concepts.
